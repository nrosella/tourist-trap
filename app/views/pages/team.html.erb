		<p>I grew up in cow territory outside Burlington, VT. Fun fact: there are more cows in my hometown than people. I was a competitive runner, and while chasing those dreams, I worked in the New York Department of Education as both an ESL and ELA teacher. I'm now coding. Cool beans.</p>

		<h3>Nino Rosella  <a href="https://github.com/nrosella"><%= image_tag('GitHub-Mark.png', size: "40x40")%></a></h3>
		<p>I'm from the UK and have a career in marketing. I fell in love with code when I had to build a simple Wordpress website at work. I got fed up of selling other people's amazing creations and took the leap to learn code at Flatiron School to build some of my own.</p>
